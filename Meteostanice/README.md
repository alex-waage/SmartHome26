# Meteostanice 1.0

I decided to make this little meteo station for my SmartHome project. I know it is not the most representative thing, but I have to make this meteo really fast and there is not space for much elaboration. Anyway, It is just the 1.0 version; the next version will be more professional.

__How to program this meteostation__

Actually, there are a lot of different ways to program meteo like this. I set up my meteo through add-on "ESPHome" on "Home Assistant".
If you want just an Arduino program, then you can use [my small program](https://github.com/alex-waage/SmartHome26/tree/main/Meteostanice/pre-final) and put it into something bigger.
