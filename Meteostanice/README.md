# Meteostanice 1.0

I decided to make this little meteo station for my SmartHome project. I know it is not the most representative thing, but I have to make this meteo really fast and there is not space for much elaboration. Anyway, It is just the 1.0 version the next version will be more professional.

### How to program this meteostation

Actually, there are a lot of different ways to program meteo like this. I set up my meteo [through add-on](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html#:~:text=Connecting%20your%20device%20to%20Home%20Assistant,-Once%20your%20configuration&text=Click%20on%20the%20%E2%80%9CAdd%20Integration,to%20add%20multiple%20esphome%20devices.) "ESPHome" on "Home Assistant".
If you want just an Arduino program, then you can use [my small program](https://github.com/alex-waage/SmartHome26/tree/main/Meteostanice/pre-final) and put it into something bigger.
