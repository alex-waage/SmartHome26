# SmartHome26
<!-- Small talk -->
Since I have started with Arduino, I wanted to make solution's, which will be smart and effective. Last time I was thinking, how to make my house locally smarter through all the devices that I have had or I have made.

<!-- About project, tech specs -->
So there were so many options to choose from. And actually I was thinking about three of all:
* Some commercial solution like Loxone or Tecomat
* Little bit harder, but make my own server with UI & UX
* Home Assistant based on Linux and this was right choose

I made a "[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)" server based on RPI 4 (2GB ram). Print some case, and here is it :D. I mean, the best thing on Home Assistant is, that you can implement your project's same way as commerical. Also is really simple to set up and to use.
