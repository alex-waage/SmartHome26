# How to flash Sonoff to Tasmota firmware
After some experiences with commercial's firmware, for example "ewelink", I decided, that I don't want this type of devices at home. So here is Tasmota! Tasmota is basically open-source firmware for IoT gadgets based on ESP chips.

#### What do you need to flash?
 * FTDI FT232rl - converter (price about 3$),
 * SW for flash - I am using "[Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer)", cause you can compile and run it on linux,
 * new firmware - just download firmware (cz version) from [here](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases/download/v11.0.0/tasmota-CZ.bin).

 ### Ok, actually I have all of these stuff, what now?
 If I forget that you can flash the firmware from some company, then you can also flash your firmware by yourself.
But I want to be honest before I find the right grip, so I destroyed one sonoff and went through a lot of materials. However, I found one for the switches that I would like to share with you. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teEEMM_cCxQ).
